      The Conscientious Traveler Manifesto
    </h1>

    <p>
      The world is getting progressively smaller, and time is getting progressively shorter and dearer. People have
      started
      traveling more and more. It’s now easier to reach different parts of our planet than it ever was. The world has
      become a
      “Global village”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Couple of decades ago, most of the people were limited to a place where they lived, due to work, life, housing and
      all
      of those creature comforts, not more and more people choose a nomadic lifestyle, and that in turn has shown to
      have
      a
      massive impact on our planet. There are more flights than ever, and new influx of tourism to new places is greater
      than
      it ever was. While convenient this has given a rise to non sustainable and non ecological practices, we have seen
      dying
      of the reefs, melting of glaciers, overcrowded beaches and mountains. All those people leave traces, trash,
      footprints.
      Sometimes, You don’t realize the impact of Your actions. Sometimes, You don’t have a choice. You need to get to
      that
      meeting in time. You need to get to that event.
    </p>
    <p>
      But You have a choice of how You’re going to spend Your own free time, and Your own money. It is possible to have
      a
      positive impact on the planet. It is possible to have a say in it. Travel accounts for the most CO2 You create.
      But
      it’s
      not only that. You are not a statistic. It's the fact that unbeknownst You sometimes supported unsustainable
      businesses,
      places who have profit first in foremost and who do not care for our environment, or even worse, harm it. We are
      all
      guilty of that. Me, you, him, her. Everybody. And most of the time, the reason for that is the lack of correct
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to create this platform to help people change their way of thinking and observing travel and tourism. A
      place
      where You can get inspiration, ideas, where You can see what You can do, if You just change Your perspective. That
      flight and 2 days more in the city You set out to visit? Or 2 days travel through scenic landscapes and stopping
      along
      the way to realize how beautiful this planet we call home it is. And when You arrive, would You rather give Your
      money
      to a business which in turn does damage to the environment, or one which is smaller and tries to do it’s best. The
      choice will always be Yours, I just want to make people aware of the alternatives. It’s great to buy eco friendly
      clothes from recycled materials. Or an EV, lowering Your carbon footprint. But one conscienceless travel will
      offset
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want this to be my legacy. I want to do something to try and make a world cleaner and better place. And I want
      to
      give
      others the choice to do the same thing.

    </p>
    <p>
      I intend for this platform to be always free for its users. Because the information has to be always free if we
      want
      to
      change anything. This should be a place for people to share their experiences and reach out to others. Help them
      travel
      greener. And help them support green minded businesses. Any change starts from us.
